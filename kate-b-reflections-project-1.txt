You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

---

* I have learned workflow shortcuts for saving and refreshing between Sublime and Chrome, which I have been relunctant to get used to using previously. Sometimes, habits that have been ingrained for years are hard to overcome.  I also don't use HTML tags very often unless I'm doing a project and so, I tend to forget each time I go back to a web development project.
  
* It's been easy to understand what it is that the assignment is asking us to do.

* It's been difficult to understand how to use Github, but I want to become comfortable with it.  For this reason, I'm adding my project here.  This should be the link:  https://github.com/Bodleen/Google-Scholarship/blob/master/mockup-to-article.html

* The primary problem solving strategy that I learned from the first project is paying extra attention to detail, asking myself exactly what this project is asking me to do, and reminding myself not to go beyond the scope of the instructions.  For instance, I want to add CSS style rules into the head (and I have in comments) but I must remember that the focus on this project is HTML and not CSS.  Read the instructions carefully.  Understand what it is that needs to be done to complete it successfully. Pay attention to details. Don't worry about doing things that aren't part of the lesson.

Thank you!
